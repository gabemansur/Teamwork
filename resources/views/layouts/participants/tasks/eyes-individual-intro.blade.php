        Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task
      </h2>
      <h3>
        For each set of eyes, select which word best describes what
        the person in the picture is thinking or feeling. You may feel that more
        than one word is applicable but please choose just one word, the word
        which you consider to be most suitable. Before making your choice, make
        sure that you have read all 4 words. You should try to do the task as
        quickly as possible but you will not be timed. If you don't know
        what a word means you can look it up.

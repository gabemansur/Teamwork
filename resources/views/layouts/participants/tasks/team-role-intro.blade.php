        The Team Role Test
      </h2>
      <h3>
        The purpose of this test is to better understand how you work in a
        team context.  You will be asked to make judgments about the best
        ways to act in a team facing a specific situation.  You will be
        presented with ten separate situation descriptions, each of which is
        followed by ten potential responses.  You will indicate how effective
        each of the responses would be.  Your responses are extremely important
        so please complete each rating carefully.

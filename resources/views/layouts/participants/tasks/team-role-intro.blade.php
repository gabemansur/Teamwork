        The Team Role Test
      </h2>
      <h3>
        The purpose of this test is to better understand how you work in a
        team context. You will be asked to make judgments about the best ways
        to act in a team facing a specific situation. You will try to identify
        good responses. Some answers are better than others!
      </h3>
      <h3>
        You will be presented with several different situations. You will have
        3 minutes for each situation (see the timer in the top left of the
        screen).
